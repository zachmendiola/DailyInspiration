There's No Divine Justice. If There Was, You'd Be Dead. And That Girl Would Be Alive.
You're S***T At Dying, You Know That?
I'm Honest. It's The WORLD That's Awful.
Thoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a sermon. Because if you are, the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back 19 times just to watch you die when I chuck you over this f***ing wall.
Hate's As Good A Thing As Any To Keep A Person Going, Better Than Most.
The World Is Built By Killers... So You Better Get Used To Looking At Them.
Remember Me? Yeah, You Do. You're Even Uglier Than I Am Now.
I'll have to eat every f***ing chicken in this room.
I understand that if any more words come pouring out your c*nt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every f*cking chicken in this room.
Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his f*cking corpse.
I don't give two sh*ts about wildlings. It's gingers I hate.
You're a cold little b*tch aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive.
F*ck the Kingsguard. F*ck the city. F*ck the King.
Look at me! You want to be like me? You come with me, you die here.
I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's c*nt.
Lots of c*nts.
Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something. That's whinging.
I'd tell him to shut the f*ck up so I can get some sleep.
You can still smell the burning bodies, and that's where your mind is at?
Someone bring me a drink... F*ck the water, bring me wine!
Poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel.
Man's got to have a code.
Of course you are. You're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it. The closer you get, the worse the fear gets. No point in trying to hide behind that face. I know fear when I see it. Seen it a lot.
No, it gives me joy to kill people.
How can a man not keep ale in his home?
Next time you're going to do something like that, tell me first!
I beat you because I'm better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord, and I'm better than you now.
Killing is the sweetest thing there is.
Seems every bad idea has some Lannister after it.
I'm no Sir.
Any of these flaming arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts.
You're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty and hungry.
Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first.
There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.
We come across my brother? Maybe we can both cross a name off our list.
Careful Beric, you lost your priest. This is your last life.
You're very kind. Someday it will get you killed.
How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?
I knew fear when I saw it in you.
If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked. That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat.
This day's really not working out the way you planned.
You've got real powerful magic to figure that out. Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? "It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy. It's gonna be a cold night".
He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the Mad king had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.
I like to fight up close. I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.
You never knew my brother, he once killed a man for snoring.
It's my damn luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.
There's plenty worse than me. There's men who like to beat little girls.
I killed you once before, Dondarrion. Happy to do it again.
Kill me and you're free, but if I live, I'll break both your hands.
What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year.
I've known you a long time, Dondarrion. And I always thought you were dull as dirt.
I left this shit city cause I didn't wanna die it in. Am I gonna die in it?
Remember what happens to children who run.
You're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it. The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.
You never used to shut up. Now you're just sitting there like a mute.
